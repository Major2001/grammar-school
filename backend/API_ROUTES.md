## üìù Notes

- All exam management routes (CRUD) are in **exams.py**
- Admin-only routes are prefixed with `/admin/` and check for admin status
- Exam creation now includes 50 answer keys (A, B, C, D) stored directly in the exam record
- Exam grading routes are in **exam_attempt.py**
- File uploads (diagrams) are in **admin.py**
- Questions are now generated dynamically (50 generic questions) for grading purposes

## üéØ Exam System

The system now uses a simplified approach:
- **Admin creates exams** with title, description, and 50 answer keys
- **Users grade exams** by selecting answers for 50 questions (A, B, C, D)
- **System calculates scores** by comparing user answers with stored answer keys
- **Results are saved** as exam attempts with scores and percentages
